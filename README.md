# CDK Template TypeScript

Custom template for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Create Repository from Template by GitHub UI

1. Follow this guide:
   [Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)

1. On the second step select our template: `cdk-template-typescript`

## Update Template Information

Update `package.json` file with the new repository name, description and add
yourself as new contributor.

```json
{
  "name": "[repository-name]",
  "description": "[repository-description]",
  "repository": "ddias-dev/[repository-name]",
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "Diego Dias",
      "email": "ddias.dev@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "[developer-name]",
      "email": "[developer-email]"
    }
  ],
  "bugs": "https://github.com/ddias-dev/[repository-name]/issues",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/ddias-dev/[repository-name]#readme"
}
```

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better
programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is the Jira issue identifier

### Commit Message Format

```text
feat(PLAT-1): Add hat wobble
^--^ ^----^  ^------------^
|    |       |
|    |       +---> Summary in present tense and must be sentence-case.
|    |
|    +-----------> Jira issue identifier.
|
+----------------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Using GitHub Actions that is a continuous integration and continuous delivery
(CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment
pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to
your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

The workflows are divide by:

- `deploy-[env]`: deploy the infrastructure to a specific environment.

- `release`: is a semantic release that analyzer commits and might generate a
  release notes and new version based on semantics commits.

- `test`: is triggered by pull requests, to run the testing before merge to
  main.
